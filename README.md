# run

This is a terminal-based application written in Rust, designed to execute a series of tasks with interactive options.
The application displays a task list through a TUI (Text User Interface) and allows users to select and execute
corresponding operations. The application supports the following features:

1. Task Management: The app loads and displays a list of tasks (including direct tasks and tasks with options). Users
   can choose tasks and execute them.
2. Command Execution: Each task is associated with a command (e.g., shell commands) managed by the Shell structure.
3. Interactive Selection: For tasks with options, users can select different options, and the app will execute the
   corresponding command based on the selected option.
4. Terminal Interface: Tasks are displayed through a TUI interface, and the execution result is shown in real time.

The app supports:

- Multi-platform: It works on Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.
- Dynamic Updates: The output of task execution is dynamically updated and displayed in the terminal.
